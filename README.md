# Terminal Games
Terminal games is a python based project that is a collection of games that can be played in the terminal. It is designed to be fun, retro-style games 
that can be played in any terminal. I used Python to code this because I am interested in learning more about the language and its uses. Some of the
challanges that I faced while creating this involved many of the new features I learned while coding it including, classes, functions, and libraries. I
hope to beable to add more games to this project in the future and hope that others can add games to it to.
